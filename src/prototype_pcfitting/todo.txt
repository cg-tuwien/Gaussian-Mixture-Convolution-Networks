Things To Do:

- Figure out Out Of Memory Error when working on complete batch
- Measure total running time
- TerminationCriterions should check each GMM individually. Can return an "operation mask", that is a list of pc indices
- Check if Adam needs fixed size GMMs, as Eckart would usually return a somewhat arbitrary amount
