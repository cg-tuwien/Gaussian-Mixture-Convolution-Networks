# Gaussian-Mixture-Convolution-Networks
This repository holds the code for the ICLR 2022 paper Gaussian Mixture Convolution Networks (https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Gaussian-Mixture-Convolution-Networks/blob/master/documentation/2022_iclr_Gaussian_Mixture_Convolution_Networks.pdf)

src/pcfitting is code used to fit Gaussian mixtures to existing point clouds.
src/gmc contains a pytorch module, that implements a Gaussian mixture library, i.e., this is the interesting one.
src/\*_classification contain the starters for training.

Setting all this up is certainly not trivial due to dependencies. I'm happy to give you a hand, just write me at celarek at cg dot tuwien dot ac dot at, or open a new issue.
