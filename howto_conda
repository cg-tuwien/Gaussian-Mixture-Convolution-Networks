add pytorch channel, because they are more up to date
conda config --add channels pytorch

if you use just the pytorch install command, the channel is not in highest priority and anaconda environment updates might downgrade pytorch


conda update --all

pip install --upgrade tensorflow # or tensorflow-gpu(?); required for tensorboard, there used to be bugs with tb sin tf; tf 2.2+
# there is a tf diagnosis script in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/master/tensorboard/tools/diagnose_tensorboard.py
